# Force Load


> Added in PgOSM Flex 0.8.1.


----

## ⚠️ Danger ahead ⚠️

The examples in this section can do bad things in production setups.
The `--force` feature exists for development use cases.

**Most users should consider moving old data out of the way using the methods
described in the [relocate data](./relocate-data.md).**

## PgOSM Flex *Tries* to be Safe

PgOSM Flex **attempts** to avoid accidentally overwriting existing data
when using a database
[external to](./postgres-external.md) the PgOSM Flex Docker container.
It does this by checking the data stored in the `osm.pgosm_flex` table.

> The `--force` feature only applies to external database connections. The internal database is always dropped and recreated when using the built-in database.

This section assumes you have followed the instructions on the
[Postgres External section](./postgres-external.md) including
[setting up permissions](postgres-permissions.md).
The protection against overwriting data is built into the `pgosm_flex.py` logic
ran via `docker exec`.  With PgOSM Flex 0.8.1 and later, running the following
command twice in a row will result in an 


```bash
docker exec -it \
    pgosm python3 docker/pgosm_flex.py \
    --ram=8 \
    --region=north-america/us \
    --subregion=district-of-columbia
```

Running the `docker exec` step a second time would result in
the following error.

```bash
2023-05-29 08:08:19,495:ERROR:pgosm-flex:import_mode:Prior data exists in the osm schema and --force was not used.
2023-05-29 08:08:19,495:ERROR:pgosm-flex:pgosm_flex:Not okay to run PgOSM Flex. Exiting
```


## Using `--force`

To overwrite and reload data, use the `--force` option with the `docker exec`
command.


```bash
docker exec -it \
    pgosm python3 docker/pgosm_flex.py \
    --ram=8 \
    --region=north-america/us \
    --subregion=district-of-columbia \
    --force
```


Using `--force` outputs the following message during import when prior data exists.

```
2023-05-14 15:09:12,457:WARNING:pgosm-flex:import_mode:Using --force, kiss existing data goodbye
```

### Only overwrites tables in new `--layerset`

Using `--force` can cause unexpected mismatches between tables when different
[layersets](layersets.md) are used.  This section illustrates this problem.

First run `docker exec` as shown in the [quick start](./quick-start.md) guide.
This loads the District of Columbia subregion with the default layerset.

```bash
docker exec -it \
    pgosm python3 docker/pgosm_flex.py \
    --ram=8 \
    --region=north-america/us \
    --subregion=district-of-columbia
```


Now run again with `--force` and `--layerset=minimal`.  A different region
(Rhode Island) is also used to help illustrate the problem.

```bash
docker exec -it \
    pgosm python3 docker/pgosm_flex.py \
    --ram=8 \
    --region=north-america/us \
    --subregion=rhode-island \
    --force \
    --layerset=minimal
```

The following image shows that while the `osm.place_polgyon` data is correctly loaded
with the Rhode Island region's data, the `osm.building_point` retained the
data from Washington D.C.  This happens because `--force` only allows PgOSM Flex
to overwrite data as defined by the `--layerset` option.  If tables were created
by layers not used in the latest `--layerset`, they will be left in the database
as-is.

In the upper right corner (NE on the map) the Rhode Island region shows the place polygon data loaded as expected.  The lower left corner (SW on the map) shows the building data, not included in the minimal layerset, is still displaying in the D.C. area.](./pgosm-flex-with-force-inconsistent-region.jpg)



While this problem is most apparent when using different regions, it can also be
a problem with the same region if a user querying the data assumes all tables
were updated at the same time.

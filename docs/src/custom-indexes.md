# Indexes

PgOSM Flex allows customizing the indexes on the tables using `.ini` files. The default
index configuration files are stored under `flex-config/indexes/`.
The default indexing strategy is baked into the Docker
image, to use the defaults you can follow the instructions throughout the
documentation without any adjustments.

> Custom indexes added in PgOSM Flex 0.10.0.

## Map Volume in `docker run`

To customize indexes, map the path of your custom index definitions folder
to the Docker container under `/app/flex-config/indexes`.  This overwrites the default
indexing scheme with the custom folder.  You must define an INI file for each of
the layers included by your chosen `layerset`.  The easiest approach is to copy the
existing directory with all of the index definitions, then customize those to
your needs.

The following command assumes you have the PgOSM Flex project cloned into the
`~/git/pgosm-flex` folder.  The `noindexes` example creates the PgOSM Flex
tables with only the required `PRIMARY KEY`s.

```bash
docker run --name pgosm -d --rm \
    -v ~/pgosm-data:/app/output \
    -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
    -v ~/git/pgosm-flex/flex-config/indexes/examples/noindexes:/app/flex-config/indexes \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$POSTGRES_PASSWORD \
    -p 5433:5432 -d rustprooflabs/pgosm-flex
```

> The `lotsofexamples` folder under `flex-config/indexes/examples/` illustrates creating indexes on nearly all columns.

## INI files

Each Lua style (`flex-config/style/*.lua`) must have a matching INI file
under `flex-config/indexes/`.  Each `.ini` file should have 4 sections defined.
These sections can all be empty.


```ini
[all]

[point]

[line]

[polygon]
```

Index settings in the `[all]` section will apply to all tables in the layer
unless specific tables override the setting.  Indexes in the `[point]`, `[line]`,
and `[polygon]` sections apply to only those specific tables.
The variables to use for indexes are described in the next section.


## Index variables

There are three (3) variables that can be configured for each column in the
PgOSM Flex database. `<name>` is the name of the column in the database.

* `<name>`
* `<name>_where`
* `<name>_method`

> See the section [Most Columns can be Indexed](custom-indexes.md#most-columns-can-be-indexed) for details about which columns can be indexed.

### To index or not to index

The `<name>` variable is the column's name and is set to boolean.
To add an index to the `admin_level` column add `admin_level=true`.  To exclude
an index from a column either omit the column from the definition file, or
set it to `false`, e.g. `admin_level=false`.

### Partial indexes


Partial indexes can be created with the `<name>_where` variable.
The `admin_level` column can have a partial index created on rows where the
`admin_level` value is set using `admin_level_where=admin_level IS NOT NULL`.

```ini
[all]
admin_level=true
admin_level_where=admin_level IS NOT NULL
```

### Index method

The `<name>_method` variable can be used to set the index method used by Postgres.
This value is passed to `osm2pgsql`'s [method option](https://osm2pgsql.org/doc/manual.html#defining-indexes), which appears to hand off to Postgres.  This should
allow any [indexing method](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-types.html)
supported by Postgres.

One common way to use the `<name>_method` variable is to change a spatial
column's index from  `GIST` to `SPGIST` using `geom_method=spgist`.
`GEOMETRY` columns default to `GIST` and all other columns default to `BTREE`.

```ini
[point]
geom=true
geom_method=spgist
```

> See Paul Ramsey's post [(The Many) Spatial Indexes of PostGIS](https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/the-many-spatial-indexes-of-postgis) for more information about when to choose `SPGIST`.


Setting index method isn't limited to spatial indexes. The following example
illustrates adding a `BRIN` index to the `admin_level` column.

```ini
[all]
admin_level=true
admin_level_method=brin
```


## Most columns can be indexed

The only limit to which columns can be indexed is the `index_columns` list
defined in `flex_config/helpers.lua`.

> If there are columns that you would like to index this way submit either a pull request or create an issue requesting the change.


## Caveats


Setting indexes is only relevant for the first import.  When using `--replication`
these configurations only impact the initial import. Subsequent imports make no
attempt to verify / adjust database indexes.

The primary key cannot be omitted using this approach.  The primary keys on
`osm_id` are created in post-processing SQL and is not able to be overridden
using this approach.

The simplest index specification file is shown above by defining the four (4)
empty sections define no indexes beyond the table's `PRIMARY KEY` on the `osm_id`
column.

# Contributing

We encourage pull requests (PRs) from everyone.

Fork the project into your own repo, create a topic branch there and then make
one or more pull requests back to the main repository targeting the `dev` branch.
Your PR can then be reviewed and discussed.

Helpful: Run `make` in the project root directory and ensure tests pass. If tests are not passing and you need help resolving, please mention this in your PR.
